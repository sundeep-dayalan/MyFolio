Perform code quality review:

1. Check TypeScript types and interfaces
2. Review Python type hints and Pydantic models
3. Analyze code structure and organization
4. Check for best practices compliance
5. Fix automatcally if there are any minor code smells or lint issue. If there are medium or high code smells or lint erros that cause more changes, get approval from me with me with what change you goning to make.

Focus on the layered architecture and security-first approach.
